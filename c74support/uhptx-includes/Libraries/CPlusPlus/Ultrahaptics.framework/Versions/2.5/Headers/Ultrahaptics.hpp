   /// An internal reference-counted singleton library class
   /// is created the first time an instance of either this class, TimePointStreaming::Emitter, or
   /// AmplitudeModulation::Emitter is created. An instance of this class can be created at any
   /// time to provide access to its functions, e.g. to query the device count or set the logging level.
   ///
   /// Although this class cannot be copied, additional instances of it can be created - they will all
   /// point to the same internal library instance.
   ///
   /// The main action performed by library initialisation is to load all of the `*.system.xml` files.
   ///
   /// Since the internal library singleton is reference counted, when the last instance of UltrahapticsLibrary,
   /// TimePointStreaming::Emitter or AmplitudeModulation::Emitter is destroyed, the underlying
   /// singleton is also destroyed.
